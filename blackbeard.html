	Preface and Ethics

	<p class="main">
	First of all, let me say that piracy is not a good practice. It encourages not paying the developer the money they deserve for making a game, and can often bankrupt a studio if the piracy levels rise too high. A point I would like to make however, is that a pirated installation does <em>not</em> equal a lost sale. If an individual makes the conscious decision to illegally download a game, then it would be unlikely that they would've bought the game had the option of pirating it not existed. A game that costs $69.99 will likely not be paid for by everybody who played it, because the free, easier option was available.
	</p>
	
	<p class="main">
	Piracy has always been an issue that has been motivated by one specific concept : the large majority of consumers do not hold much interest in the legality of their product, they want quick, easy, reliable and comfortable service. If a pirate distributor can provide a better service than the "real" distributor can, then the only issue left is the morality of the consumer - whether he wishes to make the conscious decision of not supporting the developer. Many choose not to. The same goes for the opposite - if a distributor can provide better and more comfortable or reliable service than a pirate, the piracy rate of said product is likely to be far, far lower.
	</p>
	
	<p class="main">
	Another issue is abandonware. Abandonware is a colloquial term for software which has passed a certain date since it's inception, and it is commonly understood between the consumers that once software has existed for a long enough time, the copyright is while not legally void, morally acceptable to pirate. This is one of the most uncontested partitions of the pirate community, due to the fact that because the software is of such an old date, the business responsible for it's creation is usually out of business. Sometimes, the business still exists, but it would be non-beneficial (and often even a loss) for them to take down the files. An example of abandonware would be Windows 98 installation discs, pirated MS-DOS games or just around anything to do with emulation.

			WAV files (fully referred to as "wave files") are a high quality alternative to lossy media, as WAV files are lossless and higher quality than, for example MP3s. They take up more space (roughly 3-4 times as much as an MP3) but are far better for those listeners that just don't quite feel like 320kbps MP3 content is enough for them (read about those below). Technically speaking, it is possible for a WAV to contain compressed audio content, however most users of the filetype opt to use it for uncompressed media.

			A good compromise between filesize and quality. The more kb/s per second the better, the best you can get with MP3 files are 320kbps, which are good enough for most listeners. Older releases may not have such a high bit-rate and will probably be closer to 192-256kbps. When downloading MP3 releases, make sure to check them with a <a href="#spectro">spectrogram</a>.

			The so-called "Free Audio Lossless Codec" is technically not a container but a codec (which, by the way, happens to have a container with the same name, .flac). It contains compressed, but <strong>lossless</strong> data. <font color="red">This is by far the best choice when opting for quality first.</font> FLAC audio often ranges from 800kbps to 1Mb/s and even higher bit-rates.

			Ogg Vorbis
			</td>
			
			<td class="breakside">
			Ogg Vorbis is an open-source alternative to MP3. It retains similar quality to MP3 files, however often has a considerably smaller file-size. This is because while MP3 streams at a constant bit-stream (continously records data on the same level), Ogg Vorbis tailors itself to the media, dynamically altering it's bit-stream to the complexity and loudness of the audio. This means that although a 6-minute MP3 file of almost silence could be 9MB in size, an Ogg Vorbis file of the same audio could be 200KB. It's a good solution to storing as many files as possible on a small storage medium whilst also maintaining a respectable audio quality.
